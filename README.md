Near Peer

Problem:
As a web based video platform NearPeer provides students with course video lectures at a reasonable cost. They cater more than 50 subjects for now at a growing rate and have a potentially large traffic. Every Subject has different instructors and these instructors may, in turn, be teaching multiple subjects. Categorizing this data and organizing it for a better UX(User Experience) is a major problem for NearPeer. 

Our solution:
We will provide a web-based platform on “Ruby on Rails” which will maintain their database. Having queries set for every possible outcome and we will encapsulate data for efficient access. NearPeer’s clients would be able to easily search for courses offered, and the instructors offering them.
